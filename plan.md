  🔄 Service Communication Patterns

  Synchronous Communication (REST API)

  Use for: Real-time queries, immediate consistency requirements

  | Source Service | Target Service    | Pattern | Use Case              |
  |----------------|-------------------|---------|-----------------------|
  | Frontend       | API Gateway       | REST    | All user interactions |
  | API Gateway    | All Services      | REST    | Request routing       |
  | Order Service  | Product Service   | REST    | Product validation    |
  | Order Service  | Inventory Service | REST    | Stock availability    |
  | Order Service  | User Service      | REST    | User validation       |
  | Cart Service   | Product Service   | REST    | Product details       |
  | Search Service | Product Service   | REST    | Product indexing      |

  Asynchronous Communication (Kafka Events)

  Use for: Event-driven workflows, eventual consistency, notifications

  | Producer          | Consumer               | Event                | Business Logic          |
  |-------------------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
  | Order Service     | Inventory Service      | order-created        | Reserve inventory       |
  | Order Service     | Payment Service        | order-confirmed      | Process payment         |
  | Payment Service   | Order Service          | payment-completed    | Update order status     |
  | Inventory Service | Product Service        | stock-updated        | Update availability     |
  | Order Service     | Notification Service   | order-status-changed | Send user notifications |
  | User Service      | Notification Service   | user-registered      | Welcome email           |
  | Cart Service      | Recommendation Service | item-added-to-cart   | Update recommendations  |

  📊 Database Architecture Strategy

  Database per Service Pattern

  PostgreSQL Instance (Infrastructure Server):
  ├── product_db (COMPLETED ✅)
  │   ├── products (1.4M+ records)
  │   ├── categories (248 records)
  │   └── product_attributes
  ├── user_db (NEW)
  │   ├── users, user_profiles
  │   └── user_preferences
  ├── inventory_db (NEW)
  │   ├── inventory_items
  │   ├── stock_reservations
  │   └── stock_movements
  ├── order_db (NEW)
  │   ├── orders, order_items
  │   ├── order_status_history
  │   └── shipping_details
  ├── payment_db (NEW)
  │   ├── payment_transactions
  │   ├── payment_methods
  │   └── refunds
  └── cart_db (NEW - Redis)
      └── session-based cart data

  Data Consistency Strategy

  - Strong Consistency: Product catalog, User authentication
  - Eventual Consistency: Order workflow, Inventory updates
  - Saga Pattern: Multi-service transactions (Order → Inventory → Payment)

  📨 Kafka Event Streaming Architecture

  Topic Design Strategy

  Kafka Topics:
  ├── product-events
  │   ├── product.created
  │   ├── product.updated
  │   └── product.price-changed
  ├── order-events
  │   ├── order.created
  │   ├── order.confirmed
  │   ├── order.shipped
  │   └── order.delivered
  ├── inventory-events
  │   ├── inventory.reserved
  │   ├── inventory.released
  │   └── inventory.low-stock
  ├── payment-events
  │   ├── payment.initiated
  │   ├── payment.completed
  │   └── payment.failed
  ├── user-events
  │   ├── user.registered
  │   ├── user.profile-updated
  │   └── user.login
  └── notification-events
      ├── email.send
      ├── sms.send
      └── push.send

  Event Schema Standards

  {
    "eventId": "uuid",
    "eventType": "order.created",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-28T10:30:00Z",
    "source": "order-service",
    "correlationId": "trace-id-123",
    "data": {
      "orderId": 12345,
      "userId": 67890,
      "items": [...],
      "totalAmount": 299.99
    }
  }

  - Idempotent consumers for reliability
  - Dead letter queues for error handling
  - Schema evolution support

  Performance Optimizations

  - Redis caching for frequently accessed data
  - Database indexing strategy
  - Async processing for non-critical operations
  - Connection pooling optimization

  This architecture builds upon your successful Product Service foundation and provides a scalable path to a complete e-commerce platform with optimal synchronous/asynchronous communication patterns and
