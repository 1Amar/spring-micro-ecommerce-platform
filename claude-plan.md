2. **Afternoon**: Add REST controllers and integration tests  
3. **Evening**: Angular frontend integration and testing

### **Risk Mitigation**
- Start each phase with database schema and service layer
- Implement circuit breakers before any service integration
- Use proven patterns from successful Product Service
- Test with real data from Amazon dataset
- Performance test each service before moving to next phase

### **Quality Focus**
- Follow multi-module Spring Boot patterns from Product Service
- Use database-level pagination (learned from 98% improvement)
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add observability from day one

This plan leverages the successful Product Service foundation and incorporates critical AI team recommendations for production-ready e-commerce platform implementation.
