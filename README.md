# Spring Micro E-Commerce Platform

This repository contains the skeleton for a microservices-based e-commerce platform built with Spring Boot.

## Microservices

- `product-service`: Handles product catalog and inventory management.
- `order-service`: Manages orders and order processing.
- `user-service`: Handles user authentication and profiles.

## Getting Started

Each microservice will be developed independently in its respective folder.

---
Please add your implementation files inside each microservice folder.
