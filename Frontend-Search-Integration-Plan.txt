Frontend Search Integration Plan

     Phase 1: Backend Integration & Service Updates

     Goal: Connect frontend to the new search service backend

     1. Create Search Service (New Dedicated Service)

     - Create SearchService in @core/services/search.service.ts
     - Implement methods to call search backend endpoints:
       - searchProducts(query, page, size, sortBy, sortDir)
       - searchByBrand(brand, page, size)
       - searchByCategory(category, page, size)
       - getSearchStats()
     - Handle authentication strategy (recommend making search public for better UX)
     - Add proper error handling and loading states

     2. Create Search Response Models

     - Add ProductSearchDto interface matching backend response
     - Add SearchResponseDto interface matching backend pagination
     - Update existing models to work with search service responses

     3. Authentication Strategy Decision

     - Option A (Recommended): Make search endpoints public in API Gateway
     - Option B: Handle JWT authentication for search requests
     - Implement chosen strategy in both backend security config and frontend service

     Phase 2: Search Results Page Implementation

     Goal: Create comprehensive search results page with filtering

     4. Implement Search Component

     - Replace placeholder search.component.ts with full implementation
     - Copy and adapt pagination/filtering logic from products.component.ts
     - Implement search-specific features:
       - Query parameter handling from URL
       - Search result highlighting
       - "No results" states
       - Search suggestions/corrections

     5. Search Results UI Features

     - Header Section: Display search query and result count
     - Filters Sidebar:
       - Category filter
       - Brand filter
       - Price range filter
       - Sort options (relevance, price, name, newest)
     - Results Grid: Product cards with add to cart functionality
     - Pagination: Full pagination with page size options
     - Loading States: Skeleton loaders during search
     - Error Handling: Network errors, empty results

     6. Advanced Search Features

     - Search Autocomplete: Optional dropdown suggestions
     - Search History: Store recent searches in localStorage
     - Filters from URL: Support direct links with filters applied
     - Mobile Responsive: Collapsible filter sidebar

     Phase 3: Enhanced User Experience

     Goal: Polish the search experience

     7. Performance Optimizations

     - Implement debounced search (already in header component)
     - Add search result caching for frequent queries
     - Lazy load images in search results
     - Virtual scrolling for large result sets (optional)

     8. Integration Points

     - Update header component search to pass additional context
     - Ensure cart integration works from search results
     - Add breadcrumb navigation
     - SEO optimization for search result pages

     Phase 4: Testing & Polish

     Goal: Ensure robust implementation

     9. Testing Strategy

     - Unit tests for SearchService
     - Component tests for SearchComponent
     - E2E tests for search flow
     - Manual testing with various search terms

     10. Documentation & Cleanup

     - Update environment configuration
     - Add search service documentation
     - Code review and optimization

     Key Implementation Notes:

     - Don't modify the existing /products page - it stays intact
     - Reuse filtering/pagination patterns from products.component.ts
     - Maintain existing cart integration and authentication flows
     - Focus on the /search route as separate dedicated page
     - Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility
     - Implement proper loading states and error handling
